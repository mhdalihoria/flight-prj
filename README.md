# Flight test website

This is a project that mimics a website for selling flying tickets, or Trivago but for flights ;)
Life Preview: [here](https://mhdali-flight-test.netlify.app/)

## Information about this website:

- This project was created using `NextJs`, but only for front end. 
- For storage `localStorage` was used.
- It is mobile responsive, though the design could obviously be better/improved. But the core functions have been satisfied.
